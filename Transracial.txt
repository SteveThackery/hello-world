Actually I’m transracial so I’m black (but mistakenly assigned as white based on appearance and my parents).  My new identity is very liberating. I can use black slurs and have a chip on my shoulder, but black people cannot tell me I am racist and claim I have white privilege and ask for reparations from me. Please respect how I identify because it’s equally as justified as being transgender (even though transgender people hate us calling ourselves transracial because it seems to undermine their case for some reason).
